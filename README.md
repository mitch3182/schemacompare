<h1>PHP yaml schema sync</h1>
<p>
This script allow you to synchronize schema with yaml files.
There are two commands allowed in console.php. Now it supports only mysql database
</p>
<ul>
    <li>indpectdb - for saving structure from db to yml file</li>
    <li>sync - after you had changed file you can sync yml to db</li>
</ul>
<p>
I added yii1 and yii2 framework generators to generate migrations also (not sql code).
The project is developing. I not recomend to use it right now, but I will be glad to your suggestions.
